# Smart-Content-Delivery-and-Absorption

## Introduction 
A smart way to Detect and Quantify the Teaching Learning Experience in rural schools using Deep Learning, Speech and Text Processing, giving a one stop solution to education boards in ensuring uniformity and improving quality of imparted education.

India has been able to provide quality education in its cities and towns effectively, by employing quality teachers, technological aids and policy decisions but we have not been able to replicate the same at the rural level where 66 % of our population lives. The lack of quality education at rural level is hurting the country in many unimaginable ways. Substandard teachers, lack of student participation and lack of discipline is affecting the quality of education being imparted. It gives rise to uneducated and unemployed youth leading to a spike in poverty, drug abuse, lawlessness and crime. Such a scenario is killing our economy and presenting a negative image of the country to foreign eyes.

We have identified that apart from other factors like poverty, lack of quality teachers, needs of the family hindering students from attending school ,the major factor hindering quality education imparted at the rural schools is the absence of “will”. Well, we can’t induce will in the students overnight using technology. But, what we intend to do is keep a check on the efforts being put by teachers in a class and the interest of the students in the classes so that appropriate measures can be taken to improve the current scenario. Like there is no point building an extravagant building on top of a withering base, there is no point working on elaborate content or examination and assessment strategies till the time we don’t check whether the pupils are even imbibing something or not. That is exactly what we intend to do!!!
